<h1 align="center"><i><u>~/dotfiles</u></i></h1>

These are my dotfiles setup as a bare git repo.

# TODOs

Things I still want to do to make this an even better setup:

- [ ] Figure out why git add doesn't have a preview 
- [ ] Window management: Rectangle OR Yabai+Skhd
- [ ] iTerm: test font, test colors, select words
- [ ] outlines around windows
- [ ] Color scheme/theme: DreamsOfCode's or any of the recommended Alacritty ones 
- [ ] Menu Bar: SimpleBar
- [ ] Neovim: everything
